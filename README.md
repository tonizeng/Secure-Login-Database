# Secure-Login-Database
Database that allows users to store account information securely with password encryption. Users have the ability to log in, create a new account, or reset their password if they have forgotten.

When users create a new account or reset their password, the database compares that password to a list of commonly used bad passwords before allowing them to change their password.
